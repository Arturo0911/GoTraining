Differents types associated to regression:

	Response or dependent variable:
		These terms will be used interchangeably for the variable
		tahta we are trying to predict based on one or more other
		variables. This variable is iften labeld y


	Explanatory variables, independent variables, features attributes,
	or regressors:
		These terms will be used interchangeably for the
		variables that we aore using to predict the response. These variabls
		are often labeled x or x 1 , x 2 , and so on

	Linear regression:
		This type of refressions assumes that the dependent
		variable depends on the independent variable, linearly
		(that is, following the equation for a line).


	Nonlinear regression:
		This type of regression assumes that the dependent
		variable dependes on th independent variable in a relashionship
		that is no linear(for example, polynomial or exponential)


	Multiple regression:
		A regression with more that one independent variable.

	Fitting or training:
		The process of parameterizing a model, such as regresion model,
		so that it can predict a certgain dependent variable.


	Prediction:
		The process of using a parameterized model, such as regression mdoel,
		to predict a certain dependent variable.
