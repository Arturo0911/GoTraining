// Meausres of spread or dispersion:
// 		- Maximum: The highest value of the distribution
// 		- Minimum: the lowest value of the distribution
// 		- Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum
// 		- Variance: This measure is calculated by taking each of
// 					the values in the distribution, calculating
// 					each one's difference from  the distribution's
// 					 menas, squaring this difference, adding it
// 					to the other squared differences, and dividing by
// 					the number of values in the distribution
// 		- Standard deviation: The square root of the variance.
// 		- Quantiles/Quartiles: Similar to he median, these measures define
// 								cut-off points in the distribution
// 								where a certain number of lower values are
// 								below the measure and certaing number of higher
// 								values are above the measure.
