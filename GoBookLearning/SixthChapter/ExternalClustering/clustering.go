If we have a ground truth or gold
standard for our clusters, the we
can utilize a variety of external clustering
evaluation techiques. This ground truth or gold
standard means that we have access to, or can get
(via manual human annotation)
, a set of data points where the true or desired
cluster labels have been annotated

often, we do not have access to this sort of clustering
gold standard and thus we will not cover these sorts of evaluations techniques in
detail here, Howeverm
